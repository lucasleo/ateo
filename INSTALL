1. Extract the bootstrap archive.

2. Rename the bootstrap folder and the "bootstrap" part of the
ATEO-boostrap.{image,changes} files inside it to reflect the module of ATEO you
plan to work on.
For example, if you want to work on SAM then you would rename the bootstrap
folder to SAM, and the Squeak files to ATEO-SAM.{image,changes}.

3. Launch the Squeak image and file-in the appropiate *.st files.

4. Instead of copying shared *.st files among modules it is preferred to
symlink to the original version. Example: You want to use (that is, read and
write to) SAM/ATEO-SAM.st in the AAF module. Now just create a AAF/ATEO-SAM.st
symlink pointing to SAM/ATEO-SAM.st. The effect being that when you file-out
ATEO-SAM from the AAF copy of the ATEO-bootstrap image it will be correctly
written to SAM/ATEO-SAM.st, preventing evil source file duplication within the
repository.
On Windows, symlinks do not work. Since you cannot specify a path when filing
out from the browser's menu you have to make sure you work in the right module.
If you want to update SAM/ATEO-SAM.st make sure you run the SAM/ATEO-SAM.image!
We might write our own file-out/file-in mechanism to ease those problems.

5. Once you modified the source you should use the ATEOFileOut class to file out changesets.
